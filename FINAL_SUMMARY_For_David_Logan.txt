• First acceptance likely: 4–6 months after initial submissions

TIMELINE:
• Jan 2026: Submit to Sydney FF, Aotearoa FF, NZIFF
• Feb–March 2026: Submit to MIFF, specialty festivals
• April–June 2026: Rolling submissions, 2–3 per month
• June–Aug 2026: First acceptances arrive (optimistic)
• Sept–Dec 2026: Festival attendance, networking, producer meetings

POST-FESTIVAL OPPORTUNITIES:
✓ Producer/agent interest from festival attendance

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BUDGET PLANNING:

Estimated cost for 15–20 festival submissions:
NZD $1,500 – $2,000

Breakdown:
• 5 home market festivals (NZD): $250–300
• 5 regional/genre festivals (AUD/USD): $400–600
• 5 prestige festivals (USD/EUR): $600–1,000
• 5 additional specialty festivals: $250–400

Strategy: Start with home market (lowest cost, highest acceptance probability).
Build momentum, then submit to tier-1 prestige festivals.
