PITCH ELEVATOR (for networking / Q&A sessions)

30-SECOND VERSION:
"The Keepers is a feature-length fantasy-drama set in rural New Zealand. It follows Kairos, a seeker whose obsessive quest for self-knowledge causes their psyche to fragment into two beings: Corvus (shadow) and Luminara (light). They must learn that integration—not perfection—is the path to wholeness. It's a meditation on the danger of perfectionism, grounded in Māori spiritual wisdom, with a fully integrated original score."

60-SECOND VERSION:
"The Keepers explores what happens when self-knowledge goes too far. Set in 1995 rural Otago on Kai Tahu land, it follows Kairos, who spends forty days alone in a mirror tower seeking total self-knowledge. The psychological pressure fractures them into two separate beings: Corvus, made of raven feathers and doubt; and Luminara, made of crystal light and hope. Unable to reunite, they become keepers of the sacred space, guiding other seekers. Over time, they discover a painful truth: each secretly yearns to be what the other is. Their reconciliation and the shattering of the Mirror of Yearning restores spiritual power—mana—to the land itself. The story is poetic and introspective, rooted in Māori concepts of mana, tapu, and whakapapa, with ten original songs integrated throughout."
