FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: What if a festival says "FDX not accepted, PDF only"?
A: Use The_Keepers.txt (plain text) or download a free screenwriting app that converts FDX to PDF:
   • Final Draft Free Trial (finaldraft.com)
   • CeltX (celtx.com) — free online screenwriting software
   • Google Docs screenplay template
   Most festivals accept PDF without issue.

Q: What if the cover letter field is small/limited?
A: Keep the customized cover letter to 1 page maximum. You can also send as email attachment if submitting via email instead of portal.

Q: How long until I hear back?
A: Festival notification times vary:
   • Local/regional festivals: 2–3 months
   • Major festivals: 4–6 months
   Check each festival's website for expected timeline.

Q: Should I follow up if I haven't heard back by the expected date?
A: Most festivals request you NOT follow up unless past the stated deadline. Check their submission policy. If they don't respond within stated timeline, brief follow-up is acceptable.

Q: What if the festival asks for different materials (headshot, director's statement, etc.)?
A: Festival_Submission_Strategy.txt includes notes on optional materials:
   • Director's statement (150–200 words on your vision)
   • Artist bio (100–150 words about your background)
   Have these ready as text files for festivals that request them.

Q: Can I submit to multiple festivals at the same time?
A: YES—most screenplays are submitted to 15–20 festivals simultaneously. However:
   • If you get accepted, notify other festivals immediately (some require exclusivity)
   • Check each festival's terms for exclusive/non-exclusive options
