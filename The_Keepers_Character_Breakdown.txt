THE KEEPERS — CHARACTER BREAKDOWN

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMARY CHARACTERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CORVUS

Age: Ageless (appears ~30s)
Gender: Non-binary
Ethnicity: Manifestation/spirit form
Status: Keeper of the Stone Tower; Keeper of Shadow

DESCRIPTION:
Corvus is a being made of raven feathers and whispered doubts. Dark, angular, graceful—moving with a crow's precision. Their feathers shift with each movement, revealing glimpses of shadow beneath. Their eyes are dark and knowing. They weep black ink tears when alone with their yearning.

PERSONALITY:
Corvus is the embodiment of internal criticism, doubt, skepticism, and the necessary shadow that balances light. They are cautious, protective of seekers (in a tough-love way), and deeply lonely. Despite their darkness, they possess profound compassion—they sacrifice their desire to become light for the sake of fulfilling their duty as Keeper.

VOICE:
Poetic yet cutting. Corvus speaks in riddles and truths. They use te reo Māori phrases naturally, as if the language of the land speaks through them. Their dialogue is economical but weighted with meaning.

ARC:
Corvus begins isolated and yearning for transformation they cannot have. Through their reunion with Luminara and the acceptance of their essential nature, they learn that shadow is not a punishment—it's a gift. By the end, they stand as a co-equal guide, no longer ashamed of their darkness but proud of it.

KEY SCENES:
- "Ink Tears" (Act III) — Corvus alone in the Marsh, weeping and confessing their yearning
- The reconciliation scene (Act IV) — Accepting that they are needed as shadow
- "The Vow" (Act IV) — Singing with Luminara about mutual yearning and interdependence
- The final guidance of the new seeker (Act V) — Corvus as a confident, integrated Keeper

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LUMINARA

Age: Ageless (appears ~20s-30s)
Gender: Female
Ethnicity: Manifestation/spirit form
Status: Keeper of the Stone Tower; Keeper of Light

DESCRIPTION:
Luminara is a being made of crystal light and radiant possibility. Her form seems to shine from within. Her light is genuine and powerful, but it casts no shadows—and therein lies her crisis. She is beautiful, radiant, and achingly alone because her brightness allows no depth. Over time, we see her exhaustion beneath the radiance.

PERSONALITY:
Luminara is hopeful, compassionate, and deeply empathetic. She wants to heal and inspire, but she struggles with the shallowness of her own brightness. She yearns for weight, substance, and the complexity that only shadow can provide. Unlike Corvus, Luminara's journey is not about accepting being unseen—it's about accepting that light without shadow is just as incomplete.

VOICE:
Luminara's dialogue is warm and direct, but there's a tremor of doubt beneath. As the screenplay progresses, we hear less confidence and more vulnerability. She speaks with grace but struggles to express her deepest yearnings.

ARC:
Luminara begins as an object of worship—perfect, radiant, flawless. But this perfection is her prison. Through the reunion with Corvus and the acceptance that integration requires shadow, she learns that her light is most powerful not when it's pure, but when it's combined with darkness. By the end, she is no less bright, but she is no longer lonely.

KEY SCENES:
- "Radiant Mirrors" (Act III) — Luminara in her Palace, exhausted by radiance, yearning for shadow
- The reconciliation scene (Act IV) — Confessing mutual yearning and accepting interdependence
- The shattering of the Mirror of Yearning (Act IV) — Taking action alongside Corvus
- The final guidance of the new seeker (Act V) — Luminara as a guide whose light now holds depth

KAIROS (Flashback/Memory)

Age: 30
Gender: Presented as non-binary but described in shifting ways
Ethnicity: Mixed (pākehā and Kai Tahu heritage suggested)
Status: The Original Seeker; Fragmenting consciousness

DESCRIPTION:
Kairos is thin, tense, worn down by obsession. They wear clothes from another decade, slightly too large, as if they've shrunk inside themselves. Around their wrist is a small piece of pounamu on a cord—inherited almost by accident but worn as a talisman of searching.

PERSONALITY:
Kairos is obsessive, desperate for wholeness, and ultimately undone by their own desire for total self-knowledge. They are sincere and sincere to the point of self-destruction. There is no malice in them—only an aching need to know and be known.

VOICE:
Kairos's dialogue is sparse and urgent. They speak in fragments, like someone unraveling. The poetry of their speech in the early scenes gives way to incoherence as they fracture.

ARC:
Kairos is the catalyst of the entire narrative. Their obsession, their search, their shattering creates the conditions for Corvus and Luminara to exist. In a sense, Kairos never fully leaves the story—they are present in the journals that guide the Keepers, and in every seeker who arrives seeking truth.

KEY SCENES:
- "Mirrors in the Tower" (Act I) — Kairos's obsessive vigil, reading their journal
- "Shattered Self" (Act I) — The moment of fracturing, the mirror showing truths too terrible to bear
- The emergence of Corvus and Luminara (Act II) — Kairos's final dissolution

SECONDARY CHARACTERS & ENSEMBLE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE SEEKERS (Multiple, non-specific names)

Role: Those who arrive at the tower seeking truth and self-knowledge
Description: Different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities. They represent the universal human need for understanding. Some are Kai Tahu, some are pākehā, some are mixed—all carrying the whakapapa of this complicated land.
Arc: Each seeker arrives broken or desperate. By choosing truth (the messy, real center) over comfort (pure shadow or pure light), they are transformed. They leave carrying mirror shards that reflect both shadow and light.

Key Scene: "The Test" (Act II) — First seeker standing before the Mirror of Yearning, choosing between comfort and truth.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE ANCESTORS (ngā tipuna) — Spirit presence

Role: Witnessing, guiding, blessing
Description: Not literal characters but a pervasive presence. The ancestors watch from the hills, laugh at the irony of Kairos's split, bless the seekers' journeys, and guide the Keepers toward integration.
Arc: The ancestors' energy builds throughout the screenplay, culminating in the final blessing of the new seeker.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE VALLEY / THE WHENUA (Land) — Character itself

Role: Setting and spiritual presence
Description: Rural Otago, New Zealand — sacred to Kai Tahu Whanau. The valley holds mana earned through generations of connection to the land. The stone tower stands at its heart.
Arc: The land begins the screenplay diminished (by Kairos's self-obsession, perhaps). Through the integration of Corvus and Luminara, mana is restored to the whenua. By the end, the land breathes differently.

CASTING NOTES

CORVUS:
A performer with strong physical presence and graceful movement. Must be able to convey darkness, loneliness, and deep compassion in the same moment. The voice should be rich and resonant, capable of both whispered doubt and soaring song. This role transcends traditional gender presentation—ideal for a gender-nonconforming or trans performer.

LUMINARA:
A performer with radiant presence but capable of revealing vulnerability and exhaustion. Strong soprano or lyric tenor voice (depending on casting). The physical presence should be ethereal but grounded. Ideal for an actor of any ethnicity who can embody both light and hidden yearning.

THE SEEKERS:
A mix of diverse performers representing New Zealand's multicultural society, with emphasis on casting Kai Tahu actors to honor the land on which the story takes place.
