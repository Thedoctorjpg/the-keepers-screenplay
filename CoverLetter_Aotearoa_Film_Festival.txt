Dear Aotearoa Film Festival Selection Committee,

I am honored to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) to the Aotearoa Film Festival. As a New Zealand-based storyteller, I recognize the profound importance of Aotearoa's commitment to indigenous narratives and Māori cinema—values that are woven throughout every page of this work.

THE KEEPERS tells the story of Kairos, a seeker whose forty-day obsession with total self-knowledge causes their psyche to fragment into two distinct beings: Corvus (embodying shadow and doubt) and Luminara (embodying light and possibility). Unable to reunite, they become Keepers of an ancient mirror tower on Kai Tahu land, where they must learn the most difficult truth: wholeness is not about perfection, but about integrating contradiction.

Set in rural Otago in 1995, the screenplay is deeply rooted in Māori spiritual wisdom—concepts of mana (spiritual authority), tapu (sacred/forbidden), whakapapa (genealogy), and karakia (prayer). The whenua (land) itself is a character, and the narrative ultimately traces how honest self-knowing restores mana not just to individuals, but to the place itself. This is a story about integration and acceptance, grounded in the spiritual traditions of this land.

The screenplay weaves ten original songs throughout its narrative arc, using music as a language of psychological truth. The tone is poetic yet grounded, exploring themes of the danger of perfectionism, the necessity of shadow, and the redemptive power of honesty over illusion.

I believe THE KEEPERS embodies the values you champion—bold indigenous storytelling, character-driven narrative innovation, and the integration of cultural authenticity with universal human truths. It is a screenplay that honors Kai Tahu voices while remaining accessible to global audiences.

I am available for Q&A, filmmaker discussions, or further creative conversation at your convenience.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

With deepest respect,

David Logan
