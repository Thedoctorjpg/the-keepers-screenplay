LOGLINE (Use this across all submissions)

When a seeker's obsessive quest for self-knowledge fractures their soul into Corvus (shadow and doubt) and Luminara (light and possibility), the two new beings must learn that integration—not perfection—is the path to wholeness, all while guiding other seekers through an ancient mirror tower in Kai Tahu land.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SYNOPSIS QUICK-REFERENCE

PROTAGONIST NAMES: Corvus (shadow), Luminara (light) — twin guardians born from Kairos's psychic fragmentation

CENTRAL CONFLICT: Two incomplete beings must learn to work together and accept that wholeness requires integrating contradiction, not erasing it.

CLIMACTIC ACTION: Corvus and Luminara shatter the Mirror of Yearning, collapsing the isolated Mirrorverse and restoring mana (spiritual power) to the land.

THEMATIC CORE: The danger of perfectionism. The necessity of shadow. The redemptive power of honesty over illusion. Integration as a spiritual practice.

SETTING & CULTURAL GROUNDING: Rural Otago, New Zealand—sacred to Kai Tahu Whanau. Story deeply rooted in Māori concepts: mana (spiritual authority), tapu (sacred), whakapapa (genealogy), karakia (prayer).

UNIQUE ELEMENTS:
• Ten original songs integrated throughout (not a musical, but music-centric narrative)
• Blend of fantasy, introspection, and indigenous spirituality
• Non-binary characters with rich emotional arcs
• Exploration of psychological fragmentation and integration
• Lyrical, poetic prose with grounded emotional truth
