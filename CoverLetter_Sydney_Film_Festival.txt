Dear Sydney Film Festival Programming Committee,

I am honored to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) to the Sydney Film Festival. As a New Zealand screenwriter, I am drawn to SFF's celebration of international voices, character innovation, and bold artistic vision—values that resonate deeply with THE KEEPERS.

THE KEEPERS explores the psychological and spiritual fragmentation of Kairos, a seeker whose obsessive quest for total self-knowledge causes their psyche to split into two beings: Corvus (embodying shadow, doubt, and internal criticism) and Luminara (embodying light, hope, and radiance). Set in rural Otago on sacred Kai Tahu land, the narrative unfolds as these two incomplete beings become Keepers of an ancient mirror tower, where they must guide seekers and ultimately learn that integration—not perfection—is the path to wholeness.

The screenplay is grounded in Māori spiritual concepts and te reo Māori language (mana, tapu, whakapapa, karakia), honoring the land's indigenous traditions. However, it speaks to universal human experiences: the loneliness of trying to be only light or only shadow, the danger of perfectionism, and the redemptive power of accepting all parts of ourselves.

The narrative is punctuated by ten original songs—using music as a vehicle for psychological truth. The tone is poetic, ethereal, and deeply introspective.

I believe THE KEEPERS embodies the kind of innovative, character-driven storytelling that SFF celebrates—work that pushes narrative boundaries while exploring profound human truths.

I am available for filmmaker Q&A, panels, or creative discussion at your convenience.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

Respectfully,

David Logan
