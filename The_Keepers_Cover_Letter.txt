Dear [Festival/Producer Name],

I am pleased to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) blending fantasy, introspection, and indigenous spiritual wisdom.

Set in rural Otago, New Zealand—1995—THE KEEPERS tells the story of Kairos, a seeker whose forty-day obsession with total self-knowledge causes their psyche to fragment into two distinct beings: Corvus (embodying shadow and doubt) and Luminara (embodying light and possibility). Unable to reunite, they must learn the most difficult truth: wholeness is not about perfection or erasure, but about integrating contradiction.

The screenplay weaves ten original songs throughout its narrative arc, using music to externalize psychological states and mark major turning points. The tone is poetic yet grounded, exploring themes of self-acceptance, the danger of perfectionism, and the redemptive power of honesty over illusion.

Rooted in Māori spiritual concepts—mana (spiritual authority), tapu (sacred/forbidden), whakapapa (genealogy), and karakia (prayer)—the story honors the whenua (land) as both setting and character. The narrative respects indigenous worldviews while remaining accessible to global audiences.

THE KEEPERS is a love letter to imperfection, to the necessity of our shadows, and to the communities (ancestral and contemporary) that witness our transformation.

I believe THE KEEPERS aligns with [Festival Name]'s commitment to [mention specific festival values: bold storytelling / international perspectives / genre innovation / spiritual inquiry / etc.], and I am honored to submit this work for consideration.

I am available for Q&A, further discussion, or production meetings at your convenience.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]

FESTIVAL SUBMISSION TIPS:

1. PERSONALIZE: Research the festival's recent winners, selected shorts, and stated values. Mention a specific past selection that resonated with you.

2. FORMATTING: Follow festival guidelines exactly. Most accept PDF or Final Draft format. Always include your cover letter as a PDF, not embedded in the file.

3. TIMING: Submit early (don't wait until the deadline—servers can get congested). Keep a copy of your submission confirmation.

4. FOLLOW-UP: Some festivals allow brief follow-ups if your submission isn't acknowledged within their stated timeline. Check their policy.

5. MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS: It's acceptable to submit to multiple festivals simultaneously (most screenplays do). However, notify festivals immediately if your screenplay is selected elsewhere.

6. INDUSTRY FESTIVALS: Consider a mix of tier-1 festivals (Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, Berlin) and regional/specialty festivals. THE KEEPERS's themes may appeal particularly to:
   - Festivals emphasizing character-driven narratives
   - Festivals celebrating international or indigenous voices
   - Festivals focused on fantasy/magical realism
   - Festivals in Australia/New Zealand (home territory)
   - Festivals celebrating music/song integration in film

7. CONTINGENCY: Prepare a brief "pitching" version of the logline in case you get meetings or inquiries after submission.
