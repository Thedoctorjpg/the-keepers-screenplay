Dear New Zealand International Film Festival Selection Committee,

I am delighted to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) to the New Zealand International Film Festival. As a Kiwi screenwriter, I am honored by NZIFF's commitment to celebrating both New Zealand cinema and international voices—and THE KEEPERS straddles both worlds.

THE KEEPERS explores the psychological and spiritual journey of Kairos, whose obsessive quest for total self-knowledge fractures their psyche into two beings: Corvus (shadow) and Luminara (light). Set in rural Otago on Kai Tahu land, the narrative unfolds as these two incomplete beings become Keepers of an ancient mirror tower, guiding seekers toward the truth that wholeness requires integration of contradiction, not erasure of darkness.

The screenplay integrates te reo Māori, Kai Tahu spiritual concepts (mana, tapu, whakapapa), and pounamu symbolism throughout. Yet it is written in a way that speaks to universal human experiences: the danger of perfectionism, the loneliness of trying to be only light or only shadow, and the redemptive power of accepting all parts of ourselves.

The narrative is punctuated by ten original songs—not a musical, but a lyrical drama where music externalizes psychological truth. The tone is ethereal yet grounded, poetic yet intimate.

I believe THE KEEPERS represents the kind of artistically bold, culturally grounded storytelling that NZIFF champions—work that honors our place and our people while speaking to audiences worldwide.

I would welcome the opportunity to represent this work at your festival and am available for any filmmaker Q&A or panel discussions.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

Respectfully,

David Logan
