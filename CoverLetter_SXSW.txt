Dear SXSW Narrative Feature Programming Team,

I am excited to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) to SXSW. THE KEEPERS is a New Zealand-authored work that I believe aligns with SXSW's celebrated reputation for championing emerging voices, innovative narratives, and music-integrated storytelling.

THE KEEPERS tells the story of Kairos, a seeker whose obsessive quest for total self-knowledge fractures their psyche into two distinct beings: Corvus (shadow and doubt) and Luminara (light and possibility). Set in rural Otago in 1995, the screenplay unfolds as these two incomplete beings become Keepers of an ancient mirror tower, learning the difficult truth that wholeness is not about perfection—it's about integration.

What makes THE KEEPERS distinctive is its deep integration of ten original songs throughout the narrative—not a musical, but a lyrical drama where music externalizes psychological and spiritual truth. The screenplay explores themes of perfectionism, the necessity of shadow, and the redemptive power of honesty, all grounded in Māori spiritual concepts (mana, tapu, whakapapa) and set on Kai Tahu land.

The tone is poetic yet grounded, ethereal yet intimate. The narrative structure is innovative—five acts, multiple timelines, the intersection of fantasy and introspection.

I believe THE KEEPERS represents the kind of bold, music-integrated, character-driven storytelling that SXSW has championed—work that transcends genre while speaking to universal human truths.

I would welcome the opportunity to present this work at SXSW and am available for filmmaker panels, Q&A sessions, or creative discussion.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

Best regards,

David Logan
