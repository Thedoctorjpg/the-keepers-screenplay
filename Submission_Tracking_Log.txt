BUDGET TRACKING

Total Festival Submission Budget (Year 1):
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Estimated cost for 15–20 festival submissions: NZD $1,500 – $2,000
(including international currency conversions)

Breakdown by tier:
• Tier 1 (prestige): $90–165 NZD per festival
• Tier 2–3 (regional): $50–99 NZD per festival
• Tier 4 (specialty): $40–124 NZD per festival

Recommended approach:
1. Start with Tier 3 home market (lowest cost, highest acceptance probability)
2. Mix in Tier 2–3 regional festivals (good ROI on acceptance rates)
3. Submit to 2–3 Tier 1 prestige festivals (long shot, but significant if accepted)
4. Add specialty festivals as budget allows

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUBMISSION SUCCESS TRACKING

Expected outcomes (based on industry norms):
• Acceptance rate for first-time screenplays: 5–15% per festival
• Target: Submit to 15–20 festivals; expect 1–3 acceptances
• Strong festivals to target: Aotearoa FF, NZIFF, Fantasia, Sydney FF

After first acceptance:
□ Notify all other festivals of selection (some require notification)
□ Prepare festival press kit (poster, stills, director's statement)
□ Reach out to local media (David Logan, Aotearoa screenwriter, selected at [Festival])
□ Begin networking with producers/agents attending festival
