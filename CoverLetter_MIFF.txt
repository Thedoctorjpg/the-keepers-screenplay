Dear Melbourne International Film Festival Programming Team,

I am pleased to submit THE KEEPERS, an original feature-length screenplay (110–120 pages) to the Melbourne International Film Festival. THE KEEPERS is a New Zealand-authored work that I believe aligns with MIFF's celebrated commitment to international cinema, artistic innovation, and character-driven storytelling.

THE KEEPERS tells the story of Kairos, a seeker whose obsessive quest for total self-knowledge causes a psychological fragmentation. From this fracture emerge Corvus and Luminara—two incomplete beings made of shadow and light. Set in rural Otago on Kai Tahu land, the screenplay unfolds as these beings become Keepers of an ancient mirror tower, learning that wholeness requires integrating contradiction rather than erasing darkness.

The screenplay is rooted in Māori spiritual concepts (mana, tapu, whakapapa) and integrates te reo Māori language naturally throughout. However, it speaks to universal human experiences: the danger of perfectionism, the necessity of shadow, and the redemptive power of honesty. This is a work that honors its specific cultural grounding while remaining accessible to international audiences.

The narrative is punctuated by ten original songs—using music as a language of psychological and spiritual truth. The tone is poetic, ethereal, and deeply introspective.

I believe THE KEEPERS represents the kind of bold, innovative, character-driven work that MIFF audiences appreciate—cinema that transcends genre categorization and speaks to profound human truths.

I would welcome the opportunity to engage with the MIFF community and am available for any filmmaker discussions or panels.

Thank you for considering THE KEEPERS.

Best regards,

David Logan
